# Support Vector Machines

## How it works

SVM are a type of Machine Learning algorithms. It uses a representation of the data in a N-hyperplane and finds a (N-1)-hyperplane to separate the data. 
It is used to classify data. The goal is to maximize the margin, the distance between the separating hyperplane and the closest points, the support vectors.

It is most useful for linearly separable data but can also be used for non-linearly separable data using the "Kernel Trick".

The kernel trick is a way of representing the data differently without actually doing the transformation.
